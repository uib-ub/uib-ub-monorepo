This registry contains UI primitives, components and blocks for use in CHC applications. The components can easily be added to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects using the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) CLI.

The goal is to provide a set of components that are easy to use and understand, and that can be used to build CHC applications at the University of Bergen Library.
It will grow to include components for building pages for viewing IIIF manifests, images and other media. 

## Getting Started

To start using this registry, you must first have [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) installed in your project. Follow the [installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) instructions if necessary.

## Adding components to your project

To add a component to your project, you can use the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) CLI.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://chc-registry.vercel.app/r/iiif-manifest.json
```
