# Concept schemes

The University Library of Bergen has catalogs dating back to 1825. These have been the foundation for today's Marcus, but have not necessarily been fully integrated or converted to today's standards. Since Marcus was launched with data from the Manuscript and Library Collection, UB has acquired the Norwegian Archive for Queer History and the Language Collections. They have collections with registers, some simple, but others more complex.

A subject register is a list of concepts, which can be persons, places, events, etc. These can be hierarchical and can have relationships to other concepts. Dictionaries, on the other hand, are lists of words and their usage and origin. Perhaps we can better utilize our internal data sources by integrating them more closely with each other and Marcus?

## UiB-UB

The University Library of Bergen has a number of registers.

### Marcus

Marcus has a dedicated page for registers. Here you can click into the hierarchy and view the concepts. Not all are equally well structured.

### Termportalen

> Termportalen provides free access to Norwegian terminology across a wide range of subject areas through one common search box. You can search for terms across domains, term bases and languages.

Termportalen has just been launched! It contains registers for specific subject areas.

### Ordb√∏kene

The dictionaries are widely used as reference works, but can they be used for something more? They are not available as SKOS, but there is an API.

#### Subject terms for photos (Haugalandmuseene)

Haugalandmuseene has a variant of the Picture Collection's register in Kulturnav, but it's only half the size of what's in Marcus.

### Getty

Getty has several large registers for concepts, artists and places. They are available as SKOS. It is particularly AAT (Art & Architecture Thesaurus) that is interesting for us. They have good coverage of techniques and processes, which is important for detailed descriptions of our collections.
