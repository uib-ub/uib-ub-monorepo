Welcome to the University of Bergen Library's developer documentation! This is your gateway to exploring our digital collections, APIs, and the tools that power our web applications.

## What's Here

Our documentation covers everything from **APIs** that serve our cultural heritage data to **applications** built on top of them. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate with our services or just curious about what we're building, you'll find what you need here.

## Quick Navigation

- **APIs** - Explore our RESTful APIs and OpenAPI specifications
- **Applications** - Discover the web apps we've built, from term portals to digital collections
- **Developer Resources** - Get started with our monorepo, frameworks, and development tools

## Getting Started

If you're new here, we recommend starting with our [API documentation](/en/docs/api) to understand how to access our data, or browse our [applications](/en/docs/apps) to see what's possible with our platform.

Happy exploring! ðŸš€
