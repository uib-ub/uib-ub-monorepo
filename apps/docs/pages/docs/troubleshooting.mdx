# Troubleshooting

## Vercel looks for missing linux build for some packages

For some reason Vercel does not install linux packages for turbo, esbuild and @napi-rs/simple-git. Solution is to add them to the package-lock.json file, but there are som black magic here...

A solution is to install os specific packages and commit the package-lock.json file. This is not a good solution, but it works.

```bash
npm install -D --arch=arm64 --platform=darwin esbuild @napi-rs/simple-git
npm install -D --arch=arm64 --platform=linux esbuild @napi-rs/simple-git
```
