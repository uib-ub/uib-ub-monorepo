# Adding a shortcut on your smartphone
The website, ordbøkene.no, has a responsive design. This means that the dictionary content adapts to screens of all sizes. If you wish to have a shortcut to Bokmålsordboka and Nynorskordboka on your smartphone, search for ordbøkene.no in the browser and place it as an icon on the screen. The icon looks like an app, and you can click right into the website without opening your browser.

#### For iPhone / iOS

*   Open your browser and type ordbokene.no or ordbøkene.no.
*   From the front page, select the share icon at the bottom of the page.
*   From the double row of sub-options, select the icon "Add to Home Screen" . You may need to drag the row from the right to get to the icon.

The dictionaries icon <img style="display:inline; margin-bottom: .5em" alt="icon" src="/favicon.ico" width="24">  is now on your home screen, and you can access the dictionary page directly by clicking on it.
