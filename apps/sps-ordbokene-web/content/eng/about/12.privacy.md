Ordb√∏kene.no does not use cookies, but saves user preferences using local storage in the browser, without sending this information to our server at UiB. Searches are logged on the server, but we do not use this information for other purposes than search statistics. We use a Nginx-webserver that continuously overwrites the logs, so that we never store IP-addresses permanently. We also log the usage of certain features on the website using plausible.io, a service that does not store IP-addresses or other information that can connect the usage statistics to individual users.
