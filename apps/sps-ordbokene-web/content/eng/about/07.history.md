# History
The standard dictionaries _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ were first published in 1986 as a collaborative project between the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Language Council and have since been issued in several editions. In printed form, _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are large single-volume dictionaries. Spelling and inflection are always in line with current standards. Furthermore, the dictionaries state meanings, examples of usage and give short etymologies.

[Here you will find the preface to the printed editions (in Norwegian)](https://www.uib.no/sites/w3.uib.no/files/attachments/om_ordbokene.pdf) and more information about previous dictionary editors and the earlier work carried out at the University of Oslo.

The University of Bergen and the Language Council will no longer be issuing printed editions of the standard dictionaries.
