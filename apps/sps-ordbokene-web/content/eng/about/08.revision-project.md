# Dictionary revision
The Bokmålsordboka and Nynorskordboka are currently undergoing an extensive content update. During the period 2018–2023, an editorial group is revising both dictionaries from a to å. The most important tasks are to bring in new words and update meanings, and make sure that the content is in line with current language use. Making the selection of words more similar in the two dictionaries is also a priority. More information can be found on the Dictionary Revision Project’s website (in Norwegian).
