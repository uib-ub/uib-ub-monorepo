## Frequently asked questions:

### Why are some words missing in the dictionaries?
There are many words, both old and new, that are not included in dictionaries but which you can still use. Normally, new words do not enter dictionaries until they have been in use for a while and are established in the language. [Read more in the About-page](about/missing-word)

### Where are the inflection codes from the printed dictionaries?
You can toggle this feature in settings, which is located at the bottom of the page and in the navigation menu.

### Can I avoid having to click "show inflection" and "show article"?
Yes, you can change this in [settings](settings), which is located at the bottom of the page and in the navigation menu. Choose “Always show inflection tables in expanded articles”.
